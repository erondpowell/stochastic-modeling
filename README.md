# A Stochastic Modeling Problem Set from MITx 6.00.2x

This is stochastic model simulates changes in virus population in the human body based on the administration of various drugs. It probably isn't a a good enough model to be used by Pfizer for their next vaccine, but it's pretty excellent and cool OOP practice.

Notes:
A functional model can be found in ps3b_working.py
The other files are all helper code.
